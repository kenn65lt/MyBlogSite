                                        <p>Majoring in computer science is more than just x+y = 3 or var hello = “Hello World” sort of thing.
                                            It isn’t always all about coding/programming, but you need great persistence and patience to 
                                            to be successful as a student and an engineer after college. 
                                            I learned it the hard way. During my freshman year, I thought it is all about programming that it is going to be easy, but it is a very broad field to
                                            get into that you need to learn more than just programming but you must learn algorithms, computer architecture (hardware stuff), values and issues in computing,
                                            databases, networking, operating systems, and other interesting subjects that you thought you would never stumble into. Oh yeah and three to four high level math classes such as Calculus 1 & 2 and Linear Algebra
                                            .</p>
                                        <br>
                                        
                                            <p> My day starts at 6:00 AM, I get off bed, make some coffee, workout for an hour or two, do web development (off-class projects), some more coffee before class, go to class(11:50AM), work-study,
                                                homework (if there is one coming up), and more programming on my own. I know you might ask me, “Hey Kenn why you have to wake up so early when you do not have class till 12?”, well great question!
                                                First, I am a morning person. I go to bed late and sleep till the afternoon, but I find myself very unproductive with that kind of scheduling, so I started going to bed early and waking up early and I became more 
                                                productive that I get a lot of things done during the day. I feel better this way and more motivated. Also, I go to a Christian college that requires us to go to chapel, so I go sometimes but not every time.
                                                I do not have classes Tuesdays and Thursdays, more time for myself! Or more time to be productive…. I mention a lot about productivity here, my philosophy behind it is that if I get things done, it will eventually pay off
                                                that I will eventually get a nice portfolio website and a couple of web projects I can showcase which will be very beneficial for me for internship hunting and job hunting after I graduate next year.
                                                </p>
                                           <br>
                                           <p>  I must say that majoring in computer science is tough but very manageable if the person has the right mindset and interest in the field. For me, it is fun learning about many components of computer science,
                                            not many people can say they know about trees, graphs, and even network protocols. A computer science will deal with many frustrations learning and solving complex problems with regards to computers but once 
                                            you solve a program/problem it is a wonderful feeling like no other.

    <p>Oh what do I do now? This is my very first blog, should I be excited? I guess…
            Welcome if you found your way stumbling upon my blog. This is my first ever blog, 
            I do not know much what to say in this, maybe I should introduce myself? I am Kennedy Raine Maranion. I am 20 years old from the sunny San Diego, California. I am just a college kid trying to find my very purpose in this very hectic world that we live in. <br> I am a junior in college, a computer science major at Northwestern College in Iowa, a small Christian college in the middle of Orange City, Iowa. I love football, computers(oh what a nerd..), and of course coffee. <br> I am an aspiring software engineer with hopes of someday using my abilities to help people who are in need around the world. This blog website is made by me for fun to write about what I do, my passion, and what is going on in my head.</p>
